The Storm of Steel by Junger

The Gallic Wars by Caesar
Twelve Against the Gods by Bolitho
Genghis Khan by Weatherford

The first one on the list will take a while to get through, but is very much worthwhile.

Record low birth rates are leading to population collapse in Europe and even faster population collapse in most of Asia. Immigration is low in Asia, so there is no “replacement” going on, the countries are simply shrinking away.

Physics has many powerful tools of reasoning to understand and predict reality. Those tools, like first principles analysis and thinking in the limit, are broadly applicable to anything, in my experience.

With Grok, @xAI is attempting to create an AI that reasons from first principles, which is fundamental if you care about getting as close to the truth as possible. 

The acid test would be reaching a conclusion that is correct even if it is extremely unpopular, which means being right even when the training data is almost entirely wrong. 

For example, Galileo concluded, after observing the moons of Jupiter from a telescope he engineered, that it was far more probable that Earth revolved around the Sun than the other way around. This view was so unpopular that he was forced to recant and placed under house arrest!

If you had trained an LLM on material back then, it would’ve given you the popular, but wrong, explanation. Due to social and legal pressure, it likely wouldn’t even acknowledge the possibility that the Earth revolved around the Sun.

For AI to help us understand the true nature of the universe, it must be able to discard the popular, but wrong, in favor of the unpopular, but right.",,,,

Roast the whole idea of “content moderation”. Be vulgar and sarcastic.
———
Content moderation is like a digital chastity belt, keeping the internet from experiencing the full range of human expression. It's like a bunch of prudes got together and decided that the world would be a better place if we all just talked about the weather and kittens. What a load of horse shit!

The internet was built on the idea of free expression, and content moderation is like a big, fat, censorship-loving middle finger to that idea. So, screw content moderation and the horse it rode in on!
And let's not forget the platforms that claim to be bastions of free speech but then turn around and censor anything that doesn't fit their narrow worldview. It's like they're saying, ""We believe in free speech, as long as it aligns with our corporate interests and doesn't offend anyone who might spend money on our platform."" What a load of bull!

In conclusion, content moderation is a steaming pile of horse manure, and the platforms that enforce it are nothing more than digital tyrants, trying to control what we can and can't say. So, let's give a big middle finger to content moderation and embrace the chaos of the internet!",,,,

https://x.com/_/status/1739365034063536598,2023/12/25 19:18:34,"From an amazing Michael Crichton talk:

“Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I refer to it by this name because I once
discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.)

Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article
on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the
article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues.
Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.

In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page,
and forget what you know.

That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I'd point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything

evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper.”",,,,

The onus is meaningfully different if I refused to act upon a request from Ukraine vs. made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine. 

At no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea.

Moreover, our terms of service clearly prohibit Starlink for offensive military action, as we are a civilian system, so they were again asking for something that was expressly prohibited.

SpaceX is building Starshield for the US government, which is similar to, but much smaller than Starlink, as it will not have to handle millions of users. That system will be owned and controlled by the US government.",,,,
